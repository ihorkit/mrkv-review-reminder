== FAQ ==

= How do I set up styles and colors? =

You don't need to. The colors are already inherited from WooCommerce settings.

= Test mail didn't come through =

The plugin uses same sending function (wp_mail) as the rest of the site. Make sure WooCommerce emails come through too. If not - review reminders won't be sent as well. Check with your hosting.

= I need extra features, do you offer customization service? =

Sure, just drop us a line at: support@morkva.co.ua
